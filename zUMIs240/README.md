# Welcome to zUMIs :wrench: :red_car::dash: :wrench:

zUMIs is a fast and flexible pipeline to process RNA-seq data with (or without) UMIs.

The input to this pipeline is simply fastq files. In the most common cases, you will have a read containing the cDNA sequence and other read(s) containing UMI and Cell Barcode information. Furthermore, you will need a STAR index for your genome and GTF annotation file.

You can read more about zUMIs in our [paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giy059)!

## Changelog
29 Mar 2019: [zUMIs2.4.0 released](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/releases/tag/zUMIs2.4.0).
Improved stats to support protocols without UMIs. Creation of stats now also supports read group-chunking to reduce RAM usage. Rsubread::featureCounts multimapping settings were corrected. zUMIs does not create the intermediate "postmap" YAML file anymore - all options are stored in the user-provided YAML. zUMIs can now run RNA velocity for you (set option velocyto to "yes" in the YAML file). We assume velocyto is installed in path. Implemented a check for correct YAML formatting to prevent runs with bad config files. Barcode detection has been refined and now supports automatic detection by zUMIs guided by a whitelist of possible barcodes (eg. for 10xGenomics data). Thus we have introduced a new flag in the barcode section of the YAML file which controls the automatic barcode detection (eg. automatic: yes).  

07 Feb 2019: [zUMIs2.3.0 released](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/releases/tag/zUMIs2.3.0).
Implemented barcode binning according to specified hamming distance.

17 Jan 2019: [zUMIs2.2.3 released](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/releases/tag/zUMIs2.2.3).
We implemented fuzzy matching for pattern finding. From this version onwards, finding patterns take one mismatch into account.

14 Oct 2018: [zUMIs2.2 released](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/releases/tag/zUMIs2.2).
Since the big update of zUMIs2, we have continuously improved performance and fixed bugs. Additionally, we have implemented a barcode-frameshift correction, which helps for [ddSeq/Surecell data](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/wiki/Protocol-specific-setup#ddseq--surecell-3).

09 Aug 2018: [zUMIs2.0 released](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/releases/tag/zUMIs2.0). For a detailed list of changes check below and in the updated wiki.

12 Apr 2018: [zUMIs.0.0.6 released](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/releases/tag/zUMIs.0.0.6).
Improved support for combinatorial indexing methods.

30 Mar 2018: [zUMIs.0.0.5 released](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/releases/tag/zUMIs.0.0.5).
Rewrote hamming distance binning of UMIs and barcodes. In addition to faster running times, removed dependency on the stringdist package that may have led to issues with parallel computing in some systems. Furthermore removed a possible bug when resuming running with the -w switch in combination with plate barcode usage.

23 Feb 2018: [zUMIs.0.0.4 released](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/releases/tag/zUMIs.0.0.4).
Added support for plate barcodes with input of an additional barcode fastq file (eg. Illumina i7 index read). Addition of version number in zUMIs-master. Parameters are printed in a .zUMIs_run.txt file for each call.

18 Feb 2018: [zUMIs.0.0.3 released](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/releases/tag/zUMIs.0.0.3).
Switched support to the new Rsubread version and data format. Furthermore to compensate sequencing/PCR errors, zUMIs now features UMI correction using Hamming distance and binning of adjacent cell barcodes.

## zUMIs2.0 released!
We have completely rewritten zUMIs with a boatload of improvements! Today we finally release this version for general use.
For all existing & new zUMIs users, we would really appreciate if you get in touch with us and give us some feedback!
Here are some of the new features:
- Setup of all parameters in a [convenient YAML config file](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/blob/zUMIs-dev/zUMIs.yaml). This will allow better reproducibility and parameter tracking. You can create the YAML config file using an easy to use [Rshiny application](http://shiny.bio.lmu.de:3838/zUMIs-config/).
- User-definable memory limit: zUMIs calculates expression matrices for cell barcodes within a given amount of RAM. For this, cell barcodes are grouped according to the maximum number of reads that may be processed without exceeding the memory limit.
- Much increased processing speed! For our [published](http://gigadb.org/dataset/100447) test data set of 96 HEK cells, zUMIs2.0 is *more than 2x faster*. To achieve this, we have parallelized the filtering step as well as rewritten the UMI collapsing scripts.
![zUMIs2 speed](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1kwpF3cUwK8h0fYA-tAbd8MNNoCzQ7bs4)
- More convenient & flexible handling of barcodes, UMIs and cDNA sequences that eliminates protocol-specific settings or preprocessing scripts. You can use zUMIs now with up to 4 fastq input files, ie. paired-end dual-index Illumina data!
- Compatibility with non-UMI protocols, such as Smart-seq2. You can simply run zUMIs with multiplexed Smart-seq2 data and will obtain per-cell read counts.
- Compatibility with paired-end cDNA reads in combination with cell barcodes and UMIs.
- Possibility to integrate transgenes or external references like ERCC spike ins on the fly. Simply add the path to an additional fasta file and zUMIs will add it to the reference genome and produce summary stats separately from endogenous mRNA for these.
- Pattern recognition: zUMIs can find a sequence pattern in the input reads and retain only those with their matched barcodes & UMIs for further analysis.

The previous implementation of zUMIs has moved to an [archive branch in GitHub](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/tree/zUMIs-version1) and is no longer being updated. You can also find other older versions of zUMIs [here](https://github.com/sdparekh/zUMIs/releases/).
